Practical bit games
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Welcome to the Practical bit games exercises section.

There are two parts: Code reading and Code writing. Begin with the code reading.

Particularly, make sure that you take a look at 1_read_code_intro first. That
folder contains explanation about the new subroutine print_eax_binary. It also
explains about the include directive, and it contains a code template to be used
from now on, called print_eax_binary_included.asm.

Only when you finish with the code reading, move on to some code writing.

Have fun :)
