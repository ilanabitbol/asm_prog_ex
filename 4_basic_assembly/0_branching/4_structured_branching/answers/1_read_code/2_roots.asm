;
; Structured branching
; --------------------

;
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect? (Maybe non at all?)
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		None.
;
; 2.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do.
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. What are the numbers seen at
;       the outputs? What do they mean?
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		The numbers at the output are 8, 7 and 3. When we walk through the code,
;		we can say that this equation must be solved for x:
;
;		f(x) = x^3 - 18 * x^2 + 101 * x - 168 = 0
;
; 3.    Add comments to the code, to make it more readable.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		Added an example for ecx = 8 and added comments.
;
; 4.    Identify the different structured branching constructs inside this
;       code: Identify IF,FOR,WHILE and BREAK.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		Added more comments.
;
; 5.    What happens if you change the first "mov ecx,10000000h" instruction?
;       For example, to the number 0ffffffffh? Why?
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		The program will be slower, because it will have more iterations. Also
;		it will have more output values:
;
;		c0000007
;		c0000003
;		80000007
;		80000003
;		40000007
;		40000003
;		8
;		7
;		3
