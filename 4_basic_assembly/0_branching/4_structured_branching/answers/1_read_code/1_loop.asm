; Structured branching
; --------------------
;
; loop
; @@@@
;
; The loop instruction is a great addition to your vocabulary of known
; instructions. It's signature is:
;
;   loop    label
;
; It is equivalent in operation to the following two instructions:
;
;   dec     ecx
;   jnz     label
;
; The following program is going to make use of the loop instruction.
;
;
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		1 input
;
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;
; 	ANSWER:
;
;		2 -> 5
;		3 -> E
;		7 -> 140 (decimal) = 8C
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do.
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		The program expects 1 input, and from that it takes the power of 2. Then
;		it decrements, and the power of 2 is taken. That answer is added to the
;		previous answer.
;
; 4.    Pick some random inputs and verify your predictions about what this
;       program does.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		1 -> 1
;		8 -> 204 (decimal) = CC
;
; 5.    Identify the different structured branching constructs inside this
;       code: Identify IF,FOR,WHILE and BREAK.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		The branch is written in comments behind the code.
