Basic Assembly

Structured Branching

Write code
@@@@@@@@@@

In the following exercises you will be asked to write actual programs that
execute some work over given inputs and produce outputs.
Use the first_program.asm template to be able to receive numeric input and
produce numeric output. 

You can just copy the first_program.asm file and use it as a starting point for
any of your solutions to the following exercises.

For every program that you write, make sure that it passes the assembly
process successfuly, and then try to run it to make sure that it behaves as
expected.


0. Write a program that takes the number n as input. Then it prints all the
   numbers x below n that have exactly 2 different integral divisors (Besides 1
   and x). 
   
   For example: 15 is such a number. It is divisible by 1,3,5,15. (Here 3 and 5
   are the two different divisiors, besides 1 and 15).

   However, 4 is not such a number. It is divisible by 1,2,4.


1. Write a program that takes the number n as input, and prints back all the
   pairs (x,y) such that x < y < n.


2. Write a program that takes the number n as input, and prints back all the
   triples (a,b,c), such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 
   
   These are all the pythagorean triples not larger than n.


Happy coding :)
