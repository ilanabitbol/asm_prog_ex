; 0.    Assemble and run this program.

; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;       On peut voir 2 call Ã  la fonction read_hex
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand it.
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can.
;       si b>a => print 0 sinon b<a <=> b-a<0 print 1
;       Note that the relevant part of the code is from the "start" label until
;       the [ExitProcess] call invocation. You do not need to read the input and
;       output subroutines.
;
; 4.    Pick some random inputs and verify your predictions about what this
;       program does.
;
;       Question: How does this program work with signed numbers, like
;       0xffffffff? => Non, il faut utiliser le OF
;
; 5.    Give better names to the labels in the program, so that it would be
;       easier to read and understand. Make sure that the program still
;       assembles and runs correctly after your modifications.
