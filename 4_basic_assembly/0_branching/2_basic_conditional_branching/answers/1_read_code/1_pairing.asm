; 
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
; 
; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;
;	ANSWER:
;	
;		Four, because the function read_hex is called four times.
;
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand it. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can.
;       
;       Note that the relevant part of the code is from the "start" label until
;       the [ExitProcess] call invocation. You do not need to read the input and
;       output subroutines.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		Say input1 is a, input2 is b, input3 is c and input4 is d. First a and d
;		are added. Second b and c are added. When the result of the addition of
;		a and d equals the result of the addition of b and c, we output 1 else 0.
;
;		f(x) = (d + a) - (b + c)
;       
; 4.    Pick some random inputs and verify your predictions about what this
;       program does.
;
;	ANSWER:
;		
;		1,2,3,4 -> 1
;		2,2,3,1 -> 0
;		1D,F,F,1 -> 1
