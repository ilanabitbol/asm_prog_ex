;  3.1   Write a program that takes a number n as input, and prints back to the
;        console all the primes that are larger than 1 but not larger than n.
;
;		ANSWER:
;
;			Start at 1 (we can't divide by zero) and go up to n. For every n, 
;			divide by all previous numbers > 2 and check if we have a prime. 
;
;			Use code from the previous exercise.
