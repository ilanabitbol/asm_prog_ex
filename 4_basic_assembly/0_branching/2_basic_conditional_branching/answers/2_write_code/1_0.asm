; 1.  Write a program that takes three numbers as input: x,y,z. Then it prints 1
;     to the console if x < y < z. It prints 0 otherwise.
; 
;     NOTE: The comparison should be in the unsigned sense. That means for
;     example: 0x00000003 < 0x7f123456 < 0xffffffff
;
;       ANSWER:
;
;           With subtraction we can compare if 1 number is larger then the other.
;           Subtract z from y and jump when the number is signed. Then subtract
;           y from x and jump when the number is signed.
