; 3.  A prime number is an integer that is divisible only by 1 and by itself.
;
;  3.0   Write a program that takes a number m as input, and prints back 1 to the
;        console if m is a prime number. Otherwise, it prints 0.
;
;			ANSWER:
;
;				Take m, and divide it by all previous numbers. When one of the 
;				divisions returns no remainder, it is not a prime, else it is.
