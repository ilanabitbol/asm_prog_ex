;
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    What are the numbers found by the program? Try to guess.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		It looks like the negation (two's complement) of both numbers must be
;		the same, then they are printed.
;
; 2.    Read the code below, and try to understand the meaning of the numbers
;       returned by the program.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
; 		We start searching at 0ffffffffh and decrease by 1. We negate every number
;		and check if they are the same. If they are, print it.
;
; 3.    Why does it take the program so long to complete? How many iterations
;       does the main loop goes through?
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;		From ffffffffh to 0. That are 2^32 iterations.
