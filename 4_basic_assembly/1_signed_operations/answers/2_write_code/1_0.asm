; 1. Finding the bit flip of a number.
;    Create a program that takes the number x as input, flips all its bits and
;    returns the result. Use the NEG instruction to do that, together with other
;    instructions that we have learned.
;
;    HINT: Remind yourself how the two's complement negation work, and try to use
;    it to your advantage.
;
;	ANSWER:
;
;	NEG returns every bit flipped + 1. So We have to NEG and then subtract 1.
