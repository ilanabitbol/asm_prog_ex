;   0.1 Write a program that does the same, except that it multiplies the four
;       bytes. (All the bytes are considered to be unsigned).
;
;   ANSWER:
;
;       Because max input is FC05FC01 (= FF * FF * FF * FF), max. result will fit in
;       a 32 bit register. Every multiplication is saved in edx:eax (but only eax,
;       since max. result is 32 bit), so we can take every outcome and multiply it
;       with the next param.
